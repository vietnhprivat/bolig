Utilizing data from various sources such as DAGI, DAR, BRR, EBR, and VUR, we aim to uncover patterns in the real estate market of Denmark's capital. An essential aspect of the project is the application of multi-linear regression using Scikit Learn and the development of a predictive model for future housing prices.
